    - this prompting technique generally it is used to augment the knowledge in the language models.
    - it is a new way to make language models that work with the language smarter by using lots
      of  different types of information to make sure that answers are based on facts.
    - it works in steps, starting with preparing the answers and reasons for the questions and
      then checking this against the wide range of information sources to correct and improve them.
      making the final answer more reliable.
    - it uses a special tools to ask the questions in different way depending on the
      what kind of information source that is taking to.
    - like website with structured data or regular text  together with most accurate information possible.

how it works?:
==============
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd0e41b7-fc83-4879-8948-0b7cb26a0635)

    - it starts by preparing by answers and identifying relevant areas of knowledge for a given question
      ensuring it knows where to look for information.
    - it then uses a special tools to create questions that can be understood by different types of 
      information sources , whether they are databses or websites , to gather the right facts.
    - after getting the information,chain of knowledge update the initial answers to make them more
       accurate using the new facts that it found.
    - finally, it combines all collected information to give the final answer that is more likely to be 
      true and based on solid facts.

Example:
========

    - we ask the question " what year is the origin time of actor  born in 1941" 
    - answer from chain of knowledge with dynamic adaptive
    - it automatically finds out to answer the question , it looks in wikipedia
    - Rational 1- it looks in wikipedia and understand that the answer of the actor is "palito "
    - second rational -palito born in 1941 and check 
    - finally gives the corrected answer.
    - as you can see self consistency, retrieval based method both give wrong answer

practical use cases:
