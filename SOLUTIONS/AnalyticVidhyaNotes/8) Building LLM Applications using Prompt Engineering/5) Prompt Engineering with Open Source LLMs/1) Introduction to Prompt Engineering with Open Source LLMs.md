==========================================================

  - so far how to effectively craft prompt using chatgpt api
  - it is known for exceptional performance.
  - these GPT are state of art llm, it's performance is way better than any llm.
  - you dont want upfront investments , then GPT is better.
  - but if organization has data privacy , then you cannot use chatGPT.

  - as you scale the model , as you run at **larger scale you need very high cost**.
  - you incur high cost without actually developing the technology.
  - this becomes prohibitive as you scale up.
  - this is where open source llm comes in.
  - opensource llm stands out for accessibility.
  - open source llm are free and available for anyone to access,modify and distribute.


OPEN source LLM:
================

    - offers great flexibility for developers and researchers.
    - for e.g mistral 7b, falcon

    - all these are available for text completion,

    - meta opensource entire arch and its weights
    - models are available in different formats like 7b, 13b, 17b parameters.
    - all these models are available for text completion and  instruction following.
    - among these lalama2 is most notable example.
    - you can explore in hugging face.
