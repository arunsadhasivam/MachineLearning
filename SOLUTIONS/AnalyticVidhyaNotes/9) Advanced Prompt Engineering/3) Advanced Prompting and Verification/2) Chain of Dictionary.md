      - this prompting techniques is used for generally machine translation.
      - used for machine translation tasks.
      - this method is specially good for languages that dont have lot of resources or examples, or language model
        to learn from , making it easier to translate between this languages by using dictionaries for several
        languages.
      - chain of dictionary can improve how well this programs translate text, even for the languages that are
         usually hard for them to handle.

How it works?:
===============

      - works invovles series of multi-lingual dictionaries to help translate languages by linking words across
        different languages in a chain format, which is particular useful for languages that have no many resources.
      - this method does not rely on many examples of translation , which is often not practical for languages which 
        are not widely used or documented, instead this technique enhances the translation process by providing the 
        structure path of word meaning from the source language to one or more auxillary languages before reaching 
        target languages , there by improving the translation accuracy for low resource languages.


Example:
==========

chain of dictionary translation from english to tamil.

   - translation of the text from english to tamil
   - query prompt "we have now 4-month old mice that are non-diabetic that are used to be diabetic"
   - you can see standard prompting and chain of dictionary prompting
   - difference is in chain of dictionary prompting we give a translation meaning that have means "this word in tamil"
   - we create a chain of translative query
   - based on language models gives you high quality.


Disadvantages:
===============

  - cod enhances the translation.
  - this techniques is ideal for digital platform seeking to offer multi-langual content enhancing user experience.
