Course Recap:
=============

  - in this course, you have learned practical skills to build agents with different framework like
    1) LangChain
    2) Autogen
    3) LangGraph

  - Langchain learned concepts like 
      1) Models
      2) Prompt Templates
      3) output Parsers
      4) setup chain that can form agents
      5) call via tool calling to perform complex tasks like searching web,writting text files.

   - Autogen learned about conversational programming.
     and conversable agents and learned how to setup multi-agent workflows to build things like
     research reports
   - LangGraph you learned about the idea of mixing llm based workflows with deterministic workflow
     to set up interesting and powerful agentific workflows.
   - now you are equipped to do as you please and pursue the tasks that you are interested in and setup
     the agentic workflow that make sense for applications that you are interested in.
