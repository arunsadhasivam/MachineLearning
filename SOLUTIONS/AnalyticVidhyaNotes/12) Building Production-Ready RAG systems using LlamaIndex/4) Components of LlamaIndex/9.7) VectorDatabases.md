1) Vector Stores(Default)
2) Document Store
3) Index Store - index metadata
4) Graph Store
5) Chat Store - chat messages

Challenges in In-Memory Store:
==============================

- Limited Data capacity
- Data Loss Risk.
- More Expensive
- High Resource Use
- Complex Management
- Weaker Data Recovery.


  Hence Vector DB are used.


Vector Databases:
=================

- Offers Specialized Storage and querying Capabilities.

Features of Vector Databases:
=============================


1) Data Management - insertion
2) Scalability - increasing data volume , distributed and parallel processing.
3) Real time - APplication requires immediate data insights like real time risk assesment tools
4) Metadata Storage and Filtering - Vector DB allows the storage of metadata for each vector.
   This enables user to perform more nuanced queries using additional metadata filter.
   This feature enhances specificity and relevance of search results.
5) Backup and security -  Access control mechanism. this features enables security.
