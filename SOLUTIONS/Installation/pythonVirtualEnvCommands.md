To Create a Virutal Directory:
===============================

To create a virtual environment, go to your project’s directory and run the following command. 
This will create a new virtual environment in a local folder named .venv:


  C:\Arun\PythonEnv>py -m venv .venv

Activate a virtual environment:
===============================

Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. 
Activating a virtual environment will put the virtual environment-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH.
