What is LlamaIndex:
===================

- it is a free opensource library to facilitate data ingestion, structuring,retrieval
  and integration.
- Acts as a central framework to crucial components.
- Connect to various data sources like salesforce, db, ppt,pdf.
- Access various embedding models like ( palm,openai, quadrant, fastembed, gradient embeddings).
  and these embeddings can be stored in various embedding db like mongodb,pinecone,chroma,milvus,db8.
- Access various state of art llm available in industry like free open source like (LLma2,mister)
  to closed source llm like (openai,cohere,anthropic)
-  ALso build simple to advance RAG systems  with different Retrieval Algorithms available like
  Automerging retrievals and sentence window retrieval and so on.
- Apart from this , it also includes different advanced techniques to improve RAG systems like
  fune tuning embeddings, Dual instruction Tuning and so on.
- beat any enterprise data like recruiting,sales, marketing we can leverage llamaindex to build llm
  application powered by RAG.
