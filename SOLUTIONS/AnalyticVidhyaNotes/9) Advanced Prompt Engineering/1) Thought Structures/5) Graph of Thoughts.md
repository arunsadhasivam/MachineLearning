  - organize information in a network and its each data point connected and it promotes
    collaborating and iterative problem solving.


How graph of though works?
==========================

  - more dynamic than linear  or hierarchial model.
  - adding multi-directional thought connections.
  - evaluate and prioritize ideas to cultivate the most effective thought network, guiding strategic decision making.


Difference between graph of thought and tree of thought:
=========================================================

Step 1:
========

  - graph of thought creates  dynamic web of interconnected  ideas.
  - while tree of thought develops a hierarchial structure of ideas.
  - self loop represent  the llm thoughts and the edges represent the dependency between those thoughts.

Step 2:
=======

  - graph of thought enables the synthesis of mixed ideas.
  - tree of thought progresses along distinct,non-converging paths.
  - as you can see input -> output as a tree structure
  - whereas in tree structure we can see aggregation of thought , chains to get the output.
