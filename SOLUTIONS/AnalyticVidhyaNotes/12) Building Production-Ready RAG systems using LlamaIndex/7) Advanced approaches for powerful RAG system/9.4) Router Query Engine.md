======================

Naive Based Approaches:
=======================

 - when working on complex questions, that require answers to be fetches from multiple documents.
 - unlike the naive approach of indexing all the documents in the database and build single query Engine over it.
 - we can build different query Engine with different indicies.

- then we construct the unified query Engine interface by integrating both query Engine using routerQUeryEngine
- the objective of the router is to determine the appropriate queryEngine for the response.
- it either uses vector store index to address specific queries or summary index to provide document summaries.
- consider the vector store index and document sumaries on uber pdf search to answer specific queries and
  summary questions. here goal is to build RAG Pipeline that is capable of responding to queries from these documents.

 - the way to go is to build 2 separate query engine for uber 10k filing and post then combine these
   queryEngine which route them to correct queryEngine for response Generation.
 - let says a e.g what is revenue of uber in 2021,the router queryEngine select the right queryEngine
   related to uber 10 k filings to fetch the answer.
