Recurrent Neural N/w
====================


1) Neural Network -
     - Forward propagation
     - Backward propagation
     - hyper parameter tuning.
2) CNN -  Image filter, padding, poding.
3) Sequence Modelling - Main for real world
    - Machine translation
    - chatbot
    - search engine
    - Audio translation
4) RNN - Handle sequence Data.


 RNN(Handle Sequence Data)
 =========================

 - if we need to know sequence.
 - e.g you want to predict whether bird moving towards or away from flower.
 - only way to know that is we need to know previous frame so that we can know
   distance increased(away from flower) or decreased(moving towards flower)
 - if distance in previous frame increase - moving away
 - if distance in previous frame decreases - bird moving towards


Types of RNN:
