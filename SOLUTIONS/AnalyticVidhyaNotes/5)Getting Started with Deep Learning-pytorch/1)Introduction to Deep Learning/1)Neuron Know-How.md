Neuron Know-How
================


 - deep learning changed the way we work  with machines.
 - it is all begin with creation of artifical neuron simulating human neurons.
 - Artificial neurons are essential mathematical functions

 - above is artificial neuron.
 - before go for gogging , we analze several factors like weather , health and other things.
 - first part is input
 - this is features in dataset ( images, numbers , text)

- step 2 : weights: importance we give to each of the factors taken in to consideration.
- whenever we make decisions, not all factor influence your decision equally.
- similarly in a neuron, each input is associated with a weight.
- weight is a numerical value which can be adjusted during tranining.
- it is like prioritizing the weather conditions in our jogging case over other conditions like temperature.
