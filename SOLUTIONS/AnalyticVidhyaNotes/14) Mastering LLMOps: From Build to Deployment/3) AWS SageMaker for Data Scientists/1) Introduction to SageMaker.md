 - development env on aws.
 - sagemaker is a fully fledged ml platform by aws.
 - it has support for lot of libraries such as hugging-face, pytorch, scikit-learn.
 - researchers can collborate using various tools like VS Code IDE, jupyter notebook,Rstudio.
 - Train models with automatic infrastructure provisioning , so that these servers are automatically
   created and destroyed as we use.
 - manage deploy, maintain model. that means once model are created, you can save them ,deploy them to prod,
   maintain model throughout the lifecycle.
 - sagemaker seems to be comprehensive full fledged solutions for multiple teams.

=============================

  - it is no code platform for non-tech practioners.
  - actually upload data and get insights , train model without having to write single line of code.
  - team management and fine-grained access control - each user gets only needed permission(minimal permission) to get
    the job done.
  - enforce infrastructure security best practices.
  - easy to share findings with business stake holder.
