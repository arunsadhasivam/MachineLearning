Conversation Programming:
==========================

  - we look into conversable in autogen , so we have these concepts in our head of about something being conversable
    in the sense that you can make it a specific role with a specific set of behaviour that can exchange messages
    between each other.
  - they are highly customizable
  - we saw a e.g of just  a basic agent generating a reply as well as 2 basic agents with comedic profiles,
    exchanging conversation between , conversing between each other by applying , by using the method initiate chat.


conversational programming:
============================

  - now talk about conversational programming, one of the interesting that autogen put forward
  - a paradigm for implementing agentic workflows.
  - meaning workflows that leverages agents based on llm.

  - conversational programming means that we have sets or patterns of communication between different agents
    to execute computation.
  - so we have multi-agent conversations, we have hierarchial chats where you have bunch of agents **that report to a
    supervisor agents**.
  - you have join chats where agent talk between each other , **but there is no hierarchy involved**.
  - so conversational programming is all about a paradigm that blends computation and control flow with in
    multi-agent conversation.
  - so it try to merge programming in natural language control , so that you can get the best of both world.
  - so we can have deterministic control over computation, as well as allowing you to offload the decision making
    and autonomy to these scope of the multi-agent conversations where the agents can themselves make decisions
    and perform the action.

  - now computation here is , we have role specific conversation centric actions. meaning we have
    agents which has specific roles and actions these agents perform are around the scope of the conversation and the
    exchange of the information between each other.
  - the control flow aspect of this is defined by the conversational dynamics among these agents.
  - you can control the dynamics to an extent and therefore control what can happen when you send an input to this
    infrastructure.
  - you can control how they connect to each other and you can offload decision making of what to do with each step of
    the process to the paradigm of the interaction.
  - so this paradigm  is very interesting allows to streamline AI development for various skill level.
