How we Interpret Neural N/w
============================

1) understand model arch what it takes input, how many parameters it takes.
2) visualize filters and weights.
3) extract output from intermediate neurons.

Attempt 1 - Understanding Arch
===============================

1) pooling -> reduce dimension.
2) flatten -> reduce 3D to 1D
