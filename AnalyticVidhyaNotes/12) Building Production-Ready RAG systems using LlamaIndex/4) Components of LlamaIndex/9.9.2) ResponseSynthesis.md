- Responsible for generating the answer using LLM based on top-k relevant document
  which are fetched by retrieval systems and user query.
- This Response Synthesizer stage is implemented by response synthesizer component in LlamaIndex.
- Generates response from user query and retrieved chunks.
- This process varies in complexity from simple iteration from text chunk to constructing sophisticated
  tree structure.

4) compact Accumulate -    when we encounter compact accumulate response synthesiser offering both brewity and
   details.
