Object Detection:
=================

 - **classifiction** - we does till now, whether emergency vehicle or not  or loan predcition problem.
 - **Regression** Problem - Age prediction
 - **Image Segmentation** - detect pixel level, trees, vehicles, Road object detection.
 - **video Images** - sequences of images.

Sequential Modelling:
====================

  - video images sequence
  - can predict bird fly away from or towards the flower by following sequence of images.
    like for e.g if we know previous time series or previous image position where the bird
    is we can predict whether bird is flying towards(previous step away) or away from flower(if previous time it is closer)
  - Audio sample is sequence data
  - speech recognition can predict earlier problem - Emergency or not Emergency vehicle.
  - chat bot - sequencing models
  - sequence models **capture order in which they appear**
  - sequence model - text data.
