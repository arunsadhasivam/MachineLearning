Models - LLM APIs:
==================

  - idea of langchain as a framework for building context-aware reasoning applications.
  - they put forward some basic components that we're going to think about as a very small
    lego pieces that we can put together to form complex  workflows.
  - workflows and this idea of off the shelf chains,  which are chain that going to be building blocks for doing
    stuffs with llm.
  - now dive right in to langchain and see what these components are and what langchain can do for us.

  - models are very simple, just like you have chatgpt, gemini, llam2 all are options for models
  - langchain create abstractions over all these api for accessing different llm
  - for e.g chatgpt api , how to call particular model by importing chatopenai from langchain.chatmodels.

  - now above way of calling open ai is depreciated.
  - call openapi set the open_api key
  - we create from open_api website.
  - we call model and do the predictions.
