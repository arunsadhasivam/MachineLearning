Evaluation of RAG Systems:
==========================

- study evaluation metrics and importance.
- identify optimal model involves systematic process.
- we train various Machine Model each configured with distinct hyperparameter
- After trainning rigorously evaluate the performance of each model.
- Selection of best model is guided by these evolution metrics



While Building RAG Pipeline we consider several key factors:
1) Chunk size
2) LLM
3) Embedding Model
4) Retrieval Algorithm
5) Retrieval Algorithm
6) Response Synthesis.

by looking at the metrics, we can pinpoint where RAG performance is not good.




Evaluation Metrics:
===================

2 stages of RAG Pipeline
1) Retriever Performance metrics
2) Response Synthesis Performance Metrics
