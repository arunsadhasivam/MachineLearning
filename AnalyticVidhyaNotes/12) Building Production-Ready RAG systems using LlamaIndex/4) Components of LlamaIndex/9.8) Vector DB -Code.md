=================================================

create database named chromedb
==============================

===================

get or create collections if not exist

before running or create collection

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b60ee65-9d51-430d-ae1f-670033c2108c)

see collection created.

assign collection to vector store variable

pass the collection information and file path to storage context , not only
the index only created , saved in the hard disk.

Steps:
======
   
  1) load document 
  2) vector store - chromadb
  3) instance of vector store pass to storage context
  4) storage context pass to vector store index (actually creating the vector and save to harddisk)
     
see below size is db ( persist to hard disk).
