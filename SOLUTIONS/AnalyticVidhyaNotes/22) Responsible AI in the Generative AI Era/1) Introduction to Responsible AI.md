Introduction to Responsible AI:
===============================


Real life case:
================

    - responsive ai is imperative in realm of generative ai.
    - real life cases for responsive ai practices in generative ai.
    - consider bias , generative ai system can inadvertently create bias that are present
      in training data.
    - for instance a AI chat bot that was trained on internet conversation, ended up
      mimicing racist and offensive language.
    - such occurence are not isolated incident , they highlight the pressing need for
      responsible AI to ensure that they are creations that inadvertently harm or
      discriminate against individual GEN-AI community.

Need for Responsive AI:
=======================

  - then there is a issue with deep fake media.
  - generative AI can be used to create credibility convincing synthetic videos and images
    possing a serious threat to individual privacy and national security.
  - we can seen how deep fake video of world leaders making inflammatory remarks have desire consequence.

Environment:
============

  - genai models particularly large ones demanding immense computing power.
  - training a single model can consume as much energy as several house holds do in a year with
    the growing consequence of climate change , it is evident that responsive ai are necessary
    to mitigate the risk of environmental impact.


Intellectual property:
=======================

   - genai can create content that blurs the lines of originality raising questions about copyright and ownership.
   - well known case involves AI assistant create a art work that is inspired from the thousand of artists which sold
     for 100 or thousand of dollars. but who own the rights of such creation.
   - considering these challenges , responsible practices in genAI are essential.

Responsive genAI practices:
============================

  - Responsible practices involves
     1) Transparent algorithm.
     2) Ethical Data Sourcing.
     3) Bias Mitigation strategies.
     4) Stringent usage Guidelines.
     5) A Literacy among user to discern facts from fiction in the agent of deepfake.

  - word economy forum indicate 90% of business expect AI to be important to be competitiveness.
  - but with great power, comes responsibility.
  - Responsible AI ensures that the immense potential of generative AI harnessed with the greater hood without causing harm.

  - Responsible AI is not just after thought, it is moral and ethical  and imperative.

  - As we navigate this transformative journey, our commitment to responsible AI practices will determine to
    extent we can maximize the potential,while minimizing the risk.
