Introduction to AutoGen:
========================

    - defined agent and importance and course concepts in Agent
    - langchain framework helps to put all these ideas together
    - langchain allows to build 
        1) routing procedures using chains, 
        2) combining components together using lcel
        3) idea of runnables
        4) put everything together to build foundation application.
    - different framework to put together all is Autogen

    - Autogen allows same concepts, tool caling and ideas we done using langchain in different way.
    - Autogen is a framework for building agent that can collborate through conversational patterns to accomplish tasks.
    - so slightly a different way or different view on how to implement agentic workflows
    - workflow meaning that involves processing data from outside and processing inputs from a user
    - however through the implemenation of conversation patterns and we see what they are? and what does they all mean.


Core features of Autogen:
=========================

1.conversable Agent:
=====================
  - conversable agents on one hand - which is essentially design of agent that can leverage llm,
    the input from human ,tools like we discuss previously or combination of these to create agents
    with different roles.
  - we have idea of agents which are conversible and it can become conversible with scope of the foundational elements
    like llm, human input , tools etc.

2.conversation programming:
==============================    

    - programming paradigm that center around the idea of inter-agent conversation.
    - The idea that can put forward computations through communication and message exchanges between
      the agents that have different roles to perform different tasks.
