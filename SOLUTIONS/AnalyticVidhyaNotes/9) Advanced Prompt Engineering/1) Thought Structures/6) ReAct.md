 - Reasoning and acting prompting is React
 - react Prompting is a method that combines thinking and action,boosting language models
   problem solving abilities.

How does it work:
=================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a6405c-6a9b-4d31-b08d-da8ec59ab142)

  - integrated reasoning - blends the internal reasoning increases task reasoning.
  - strategic interaction - engagement with external information source like websites
  - human like reasoning - aims for natural problem solving to avoid guess work.
    

React example:
===============

question -> "apple remote what other device control the program apple remote was originally designed  to interact with?"

 - as you can see only React only gives correct answer because it goes through thought and action format
 - for e.g it search first thought is " need to find the remote"
 - 2nd thought is Front row what other device control.
 - 3nd thought and action - think again front not found, search front row software and gets observation that front
   row software is controlled keyboard function key. so that is correct answer.

Step 3:implementing Agents:
==============================

    - we use react agents.
    - pass tools (wikipedia, llm-math)
    - it has zero-shot-react capabilities.

Step 4:asking questions:
=========================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d11808-7b07-4f00-8a12-b8eba835127e)

  - ask question against agent.

- as you can see go through the thought process "find the indian prime minister"
- it does thought action process
- it search wikipedia and ask current primeminister
- as you can see sometimes agent goes on repetive questions
