Course Introduction:
=======================


- building agents using langchain,Autogen, LangGraph.
- cover models, promptTemplates,langchain
- AutoGen  - Converstational programming,convertible Agents
- finally Langgraph - LangChain based framework for building complex multi-agent workflows.
- how to setup a system , that can converge, the deterministic flows with llm llm based flows
  and hopefully all this  scope and context  build your own agent
