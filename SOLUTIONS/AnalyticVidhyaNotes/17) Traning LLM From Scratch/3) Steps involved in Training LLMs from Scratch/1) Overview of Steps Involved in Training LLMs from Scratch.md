Overview of Steps Involved in Training LLMs from Scratch:
=========================================================


    - 2 important concepts require to train llm from scratch those are
      1) scalling laws
      2) different paralleism and distributed strategies.
    - in this model , we go through the steps in train llm from scratch.


Broadly stpes involved in training llm from scratch can be divided in to 5 Steps:

1.Training Data Curation:
=========================

  - in this step, we explore and collect the dataset require for training our llm from scratch

2.Data Preprocessing:
=====================

   - post that , we pre-process the curated training data and keep it ready or make it ready
     for training the llm.

3.Tokenization:
===============

      - we tokenize the text and bear the vocabulary for training the tokenizer from training data set.

4.Module Architecture:
=======================

      - optimizer to use and related hyper parameters of the model.
      - followed by training the llm.

5.Model Evaluation:
===================

    - finally we evaluate the model trained to understate the performance.
    - model evaluation helps us to benchmark its performance with other state of art models.
    - or evaluate model for our business outcomes.
