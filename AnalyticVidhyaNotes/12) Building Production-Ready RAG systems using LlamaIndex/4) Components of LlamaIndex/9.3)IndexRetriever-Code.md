Step 4: Vector Store Index:
===========================

<p>
<details> <summary> 1. Vector Store - single document</summary>
  
  
  vector index from document loaded (15 documents) all 15 documents are passed to this **from_documents**() function like below.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29125aba-ca6f-427b-8e0e-bce715cc6745)
  
  vector index structure: provides the structure of embeddings,

  Vector index can be converted to as_chat_engine , as_query_engine
  
  
  vector index node_dict

  vector ref_doc info.

<p>
<details> <summary> 1. Vector Store - single document</summary>
  

Multiple Chunks for the document:
====================================
  
  chunk_size=512  # instead of 1024 default split to 2 chunks
  chunk_overlap=20  # end of the previous document will be same as begin of next document to understand the flow.
  separator=" " # default " " can be "." or anything.
  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7469aab-2846-4c91-93d0-5c8bfc5be525)
  
  re-create / re-index document with multiple chunks.
  
  
  check indexid will change
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cce2b8-cea5-4a7b-9e6f-732350a94cde)
  
  As you can see now more than 15 nodes.
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b403ec15-5ea9-4f18-b685-a72eb7892730)
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91517a9d-5d31-43e1-a794-62ba6e768a3d)
  
  
  As you can see 28 instead of 15
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632df70a-3ca3-4203-a86c-6f9c84f38a00)
  
  
  Now you can see doc reference has 2 chunk, both coming from 1st page of document.
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b82501-e864-40bc-8a2c-2ca345f34c25)
  
  Save this vector index to the harddisk. this entire vector index currently present in RAM.
  if happen to shutdown the jupyter notebook or kernel all data will be lost.
  
  
  
        1) Vector store - store the embeddings.
        2) DocStore  - Actually store the raw chunks
        3) Embedding corresponding to Each Chunk - stores in vector Store.
