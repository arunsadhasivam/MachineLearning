Fine Tuning LLM:
================

  - we learn what is fine tunning why require.
  - prompt engineer with funetuning and advantages of finetuning  over prompt engineering.
  - we will see performing instruction finetuning like steps of training data preparation,
    followed by training process and end with evaluation process to gaze model's performance.
  - we look at how fine tuning all parameters of the model that is full fine tuning becomes
    expensible and infeasible when models gets bigger and bigger.
   - we look into how parameter fine tuning techniques aim at solving challenges with full
     fine tuning.
   - we look in to PEP - understanding its significance, dive deep into different PEP methods
     like soft tuning, prefix tunings and adaption forms.
   - most used performace PEP methods like LORA,QLORA, IA3 and hands on project on these
     methods.
