Supervised Learning Algorithms: 

1️⃣ Linear Regression: Used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. 
2️⃣ Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems where the outcome is a categorical variable. 
3️⃣ Naive Bayes: Based on Bayes' theorem, it is used for classification tasks, particularly text classification. 
4️⃣ Decision Tree: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks, which splits data into branches to make predictions. 
5️⃣ Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. 
6️⃣ Gradient Boosted Trees: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

📈 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: 

1️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. 
2️⃣ K-Means Clustering: A clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on similarity.

🔍 Instance-Based Learning: 

1️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the label of a data point based on the labels of its nearest neighbors.

🤖 Deep Learning: 

1️⃣ Dense Neural Network: A type of artificial neural network where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layer. Used for a wide range of tasks, including image and speech recognition.
