Generative AI the challenges they bring:
=======================================

  - generative ai is a remarkable technological advancement that is reshaping the way we live and work.
  - it represent the pivotal transformation where artificial intelligence takes the center stage in the
    decision making process.
  - just as the gui and the internet revolutionized the interaction with technology and exchange of information.
  - genAI has a part to revolutionize the decision making.
  - however we need to address the pressing need to mitigate potential risks and ensure ethical considerations
    through responsive ai practices.

  - genAI is characterized by its mass adoption, which is possible thanks to increased computational power,
    better algorith, better availability of data.
  - it enables us to automate tasks and create lifelike content and complex decisions with unprecedented accuracy.
  - yet with all these opportunities , comes with challenges that demand our attention.
  - one of the foremost concerns surrounding generative ai is the quality and the bias present in the underlying data it relies on.
  - the data these algorithm relies on , can inadvertently introduce bias that seep in to ai's output,potentially comprising reliabliity.
  - these inaccuracies raise questions about the trustworthiness of ai generated content and practical utility.
  - Attributes posses another  challenges in the context of gen AI .
  - determine the origin of generated content can be complex making it difficult to establish accountability and responsiblity.
  - these lacks of transparency may result in ethical concerns as questions arise about societal impact and the potential for
    unethical use and manipulation through ai generated content.

concerns about generative AI:
============================

  - cybersecurity and privacy are paramount consideration when working with genAI.
  - the technology can be suspectible to attacks or misuse potentially leading to data breaches and  unauthorized access

  - moreover there is a risk of unwanted behaviour in generative ai systems where they may exhibit unexpected or harmfull
    actions that are not explicitly programmed.

  - hallunications and overreliance are also major concerns.
  - genai models may create output that is not present in training data, potentially misleading the user.
  - this lack of explainability further compounds the issues as genai are build using billions of parameters
    making it very challenging to understand their decision making process.

Example use case:
==================

  - important real world use case is stark remainder of these risk.for instance 1chat based generative ai
    system was poised to expose corporate secrets as was highlighted by cybersecurity firm warning.
  - in another instance , an emergency room doctor turned to a chat based generative ai system for person
    diagnosis, the ai failed to diagnosis correct treatment.
  - in this age of genai, understand these risk is paramount

  - to harness its tranformative potential, resposible goverance roubust safeguards, and ethical practices
    must be at the forefront of our approach.
  - it is imperative that we address **data bias, enhance the transparency of our model, and establish
    accountability framework**. by doing so , we can be confident that positively impact human well being
    and our planet.
  - genai is not just technical advancement, it is a paradigm shift in how we interact and rely on information.
  - as we navigate this transformative journey, our commitment to responsible ai practices will determine the extent
    to which we can maximize the  potential while minimizing the risk.
  - in the era of genai, the choices we make will define the future we create.
