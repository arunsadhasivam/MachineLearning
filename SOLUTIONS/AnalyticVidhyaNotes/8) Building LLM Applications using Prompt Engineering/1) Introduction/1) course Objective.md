Course Objective:
==================


  - incredibily simple yet powerful approach to create applications fueled by llm.
  - no need any technical experiments to build the powerful applicaitons.
  - all its takes is mastering prompt engineering.
  - dive deep in to prompt engineering , help you master the skill using various best practices and tecnniques.
  - explore different case studies, learning how to refine prompt for optimal result.
  - also demustify the chat completion api from openAI understanding its various parameters, temperature and how
    to enable conversation.
  - additionallly we devlve in to the process of prompting , opensource models like llama2.
  - build llm applications, tailored to your enterprise data   using principles of prompt engineering.
