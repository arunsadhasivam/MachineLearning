Step 4: Vector Store Index:
===========================

<p>
<details> <summary> 1. Vector Store - single Chunk</summary>
  
  
  vector index from document loaded (15 documents) all 15 documents are passed to this **from_documents**() function like below.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29125aba-ca6f-427b-8e0e-bce715cc6745)
  
  vector index structure: provides the structure of embeddings,

<p>
<details> <summary> 1.1. Vector Store - Multiple Chunk</summary>
  

Multiple Chunks for the document:
====================================
  
  chunk_size=512  # instead of 1024 default split to 2 chunks
  chunk_overlap=20  # end of the previous document will be same as begin of next document to understand the flow.
  separator=" " # default " " can be "." or anything.
  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7469aab-2846-4c91-93d0-5c8bfc5be525)
  
  re-create / re-index document with multiple chunks.
  
  
  check indexid will change
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cce2b8-cea5-4a7b-9e6f-732350a94cde)
  
  As you can see now more than 15 nodes.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b403ec15-5ea9-4f18-b685-a72eb7892730)
  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91517a9d-5d31-43e1-a794-62ba6e768a3d)
  
  
  As you can see 28 instead of 15
  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632df70a-3ca3-4203-a86c-6f9c84f38a00)
  
  
  Now you can see doc reference has 2 chunk, both coming from 1st page of document.
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b82501-e864-40bc-8a2c-2ca345f34c25)
  
  Save this vector index to the harddisk. this entire vector index currently present in RAM.
  if happen to shutdown the jupyter notebook or kernel all data will be lost.
  
  
  
        1) Vector store - store the embeddings.
        2) DocStore  - Actually store the raw chunks
        3) Embedding corresponding to Each Chunk - stores in vector Store.
