Specify Structured Output Format:
==================================

  - next step is specifying structure format.
  - why this is required is ? this is because i**f you remember the context we are trying to build
    application using prompt engineering**. so what ever the output we are getting , we want to
    use that in our application later on.
  - if the user asked a query , we want to share the response, why that is happenning. the output
    should in a format that you can store in a database later on . so you have record of what is
    happened.

  - so whenever you give a prompt you should ideally specify what is the output you want ,
  - again for the 1st customer support ticket, i am taking the output and please provide the output
    in json representation with details such as username, browser and os.
  - what it does is it just gave me the output in very very specific manner and i can use later on
    my application.

  - so that you are not trying to figure out what the output later on.
  - very very simple hack that says time when think on application architecture.
