Introduction to LangChain Framework:
=====================================

  - so far talk about agents are
  - importance and idea of connecting llm to tools
  - idea of incorporating llm with in a system that loops to solve particular task.
  - that loop involves make a decision about  whether or not it has to perform action by calling specific tools
    or until the point it can retrieve the output to the user.
  - good agent can be like router.
  - good agent might implement not just the idea of like a agent that you give an input and it return a output for you.
  - but actually some system, that implement procedures for routing data information , calling of tools etc
  - in a framework that allows to implement allows to implement these routing procedures called langchain.

   - langchain is a framework for building what they call context-aware reasoning applications.

   - tool here for components.
   - tools to access llm provider.
   - langchain here is set of legos.
   - langchain is going to give you the ability to put those legos together to make complex and interesting
     building , cars and cities and so forth.
   - langchain is giving you ability to put them together , to form infrastructure for solving complex tasks and
     doing interesting things.
