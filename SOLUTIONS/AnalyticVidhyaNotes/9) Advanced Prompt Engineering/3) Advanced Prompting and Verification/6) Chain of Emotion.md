 - so this technique starts by using  appraisal prompting, to figure out the game characters
   current feelings based on situation, and their personality, which helps in understanding
   why they feel a acertain way.
 - after identifying the current emotion, this emotion is stored and then used in creating the
   characters response to games events making sure the characters reaction are influenced by
   emotion and history.
 - and then lastly, this method allows the team character to show a wide range of emotions
   that change over time making them seem more real and relatable to the viewer.

Example:
========


    - question " clara receives a gift" 
    - the model generated frustrated without the chain of emotions prompt
    - with chain of emotion prompt , it creates a appraisal prompt , i.e appraising the information
      about the player and given context.then i might feel happy and thankful because someone
      made an effort to give her  a gift and instead two is the most likely the option is happy.
    - so using the appriasal prompt , it now gives the correct answer "sad"
