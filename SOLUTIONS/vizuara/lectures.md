I have been teaching computer vision from scratch for the last 3 months on Vizuara's YouTube channel and have been receiving great feedback. This is an extremely comprehensive course in which already 19 lectures have been released. 

For anyone interested in mastering computer vision with zero pre-requisites and just interest, this is the best resource. This playlist will eventually become one of the most comprehensive computer vision lecture series on the internet. 

I will also be teaching computer vision live in the starting from July as part of Vizuara's minor in AI program. You can check it out here: https://lnkd.in/gjaQgv9j
