Hybrid Fusion Retriever:
========================

- ensemble learning in machine learning - we combine group of learner to strong learner.
- take in to account multiple models to get strong prediction.
- hybrid fusion retriever retriever retrieves top k- similar nodes for each retriever based
  on user query and sort the nodes by ranking algorithms.
- this sorting techniques re-organizes the nodes obtained form different retrieval algorithms,
  enables us to choose most similar top-k nodes for synthesis.
 - hybrid fusion is the most powerful, power of combining and leverage the power of different
   retrieval algorithm.

Sorting:
========

for e.g above 
Retriever 1 - node1(0.9),node2(0.6) has high similarity score
Retreiver 2 - node3(0.8) ,node4(0.5)  of high similarity score
where Node 1 from Retriever1 and node3 from Retriever 2 is finally selected.


Fusion ALgorithm:
==================

- topk similar nodes based on embedding similarity score.
- Advanced Reciprocal Rerank Algorithm.

Use Case of Hybrid Fusion:
===========================
  - benefificial when we have different types of data
  - Hybrid fusion retriever to leverage strength of different retrievers.
  - useful for different datatypes like merge   vectorIndexRetriever for structured data and Merge
    sentenceWindowRetriever-> unstructured text.
