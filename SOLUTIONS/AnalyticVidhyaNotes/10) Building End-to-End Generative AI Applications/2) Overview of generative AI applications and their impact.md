1.What are gen AI applications:
==================================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ec0772a-551b-45da-b83a-2fa3fdd14298)

 
  - gen AI applications typically solve some kind of real world problem or use case like Q&A chatbot
    where you ask questions and it answers.
  - leverages the llm like chatgpt .
  - input usually include a prompt or question from user and optionally additional source of data
    like file , dataset e.t.c
  - it has backend that takes care of logic and computation and all the processing and it also has
    a front end ui to show the result in a easy to understand manner.

2.Examples of Gen Ai Applications:
====================================

Data Analyst:
=============

  - Data Analyst which is available on chatgpt store.

  - application such as Data Analyst is straight forward where in you drop in any files or
    data set , this app helps to analyze and visualize the data easily without the need to write
    any code.

  - talk about the problem , it helps us to identify which model to use.
  - supervised learning always win compare to unsupervised learning.

3.End End Generative AI applications:
=====================================

  - Building an end to end generative AI POC in a short time can be daunting task.
  - because need to build front end, backend, javascript, getting peoples and complete in couple of weeks is daunting.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192e5233-b32e-43ae-935e-2857a90660a0)

  - this is where we will show you how to build end to end gen AI apps typically as POC combining both the backend and the
    front end.

  - showcasing the ui based gen AI POC typically makes easy for business stake holders to understand workflow like this is how
    user goes in , types in something, gets back response, upload data set , gets back analysis .
  - without need to code and show this is how it looks like when deployed at scale.

<p><detail><summary> 4.Focus of this course:</summary>

 - we will understand end to end gen AI applications, hopefully understand by now.
 - standard architecure and tools to build such end to end applications
 - no code applications
 - hands on generals
 - code focus applications.
