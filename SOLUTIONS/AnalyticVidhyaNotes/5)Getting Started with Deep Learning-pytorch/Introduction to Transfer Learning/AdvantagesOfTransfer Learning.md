Advantages:
==========

1) Takes less time, in CNN each epoch takes more time.but in transfer learning takes less than a second.
2) performance is higher like (0.92 in transfer learning vs 0.86 in cnn)
3) Right pre-trained model required but make sure we all matching to our model by fine tuning.


CNN Visualization:
==================


1) for e.g when visualizing **snow leopard vs desert leopard** instead of visualizing , training and predicting
   leopard tend to compare **snow vs desert**
2) In **loan prediction** it is simple , we know we want to predict **loan approved or not** but in case of CNN
   we donot know yet what is to predict whether to identity **leopard or background of leopard**
   since we have lot of layers like **pooling layer, convolution layers, hidden layer or output** layers.
