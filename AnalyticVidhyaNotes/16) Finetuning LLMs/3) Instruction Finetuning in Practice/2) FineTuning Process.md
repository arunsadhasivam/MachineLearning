Fine Tuning Process:
======================

    - Fine tuning process starts with the step of data gathering and preprocessing and then 
      training and evaluation. this is iterative process that repeats multiple times.
    - each time we gather new data, based on the scenarios in which the current
       model is making errors or mistakes , then we train the new model based on mixture
       of new and old data so that model will stop making mistakes.
    - then evaluate the model to test with new or existing errors.
    - this whole process is repeated multiple times , until we get desired outcomes.
