lets understand what is document Agent is :
    - For Each Document , we establish a document Agent this entails setting up a vector index
      for semantic search and summary index for summarization.
    - this index is transformed in to tools that the document agent powered by an openAPI function
      utilizer.
    - Effectively document Agent can adaptively switch between semantic search and summarization 
      based on the context of the document.

    - we establish a unique document Agent for each document incorporating the vector store index
      and summary index.
    - we have the flexibility to integrate any additional index type under this document Framework.
    - when we fire query and initiated  , the system retrieves the top-k document agent say top3 
      for instance. the query is then processed using these selected document agent.
