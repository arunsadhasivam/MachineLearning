AutoGen Design Patterns:
=========================

- Autogen implements interesting design patterns.



1.Unified Interfaces:
=====================

  - standardized interfaces for agent interactions which allows for better control of those dynamics.
  - auto-reply: allows agent to automatically respond based on received messages unless certain terminal condition is met.


2.Dynamic conversations:
=========================

 - you also have dynamic conversation which supports static and dynamic flows and customizable reply functions
   for more adaptive conversations.
  - essentially in autogen what you get is a fusion of programming and natural language allowing you to have
    flexible tranition between what is natural language control and programming language control.
