Hands on: Recursive retriever
=============================

  - concept of Recursive Retriever is not only explore the most relevant nodes but also
    the node relationships.

- some of nodes have text chunk , some of them have tabular info and some where we store
  the relation ship of that node with other node.
- there will be index nodes for a table and that table will be stored as a panda table and it will
  be used as a query Engine.
- we are going to create a sql database query Engine over these tables so that we can query
  specific information from these tables.
 - but the question is how does the retriever enter the query Engine- it can go via
   some of the text chunks which is related to some of the information in the query Engine
   or it can directly enter in to one of the queryEngine using recursive Retriever query Engine.
 - Given any let say user query that might required a information present in the textual chunks
   and some information coming from the tables , and then final llm will be able to answer and
   generate comprehensive answer based on the information present in textual chunks and as well as
   information coming from these tables.
 - so where we do see hierarchy and relation ship between the text chunks and the chunks contains
   table that is what recursive retriever all about.
