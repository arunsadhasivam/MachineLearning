Instruction Finetuning in Practice
====================================

  - in this module we look at how to perform instruction finetuning.
  - fine tuning involves continuous training of all the parameters of the model i.e full fine tune.
  - we will look at the **dataGathering and pre-processing steps**.
  - we look at best practices in dataGathering and then look in to the dataPipeline to
    convert the data into final futures to be fed by the model.

  - we look at the training process with a pytorch training loop and briefly look at the
    evaluation framework for these model.
   - we wil discuss reason why fine tuning , wheren't we update all parameters of the model
     becomes expensive and infeasible as model gets bigger and bigger.
