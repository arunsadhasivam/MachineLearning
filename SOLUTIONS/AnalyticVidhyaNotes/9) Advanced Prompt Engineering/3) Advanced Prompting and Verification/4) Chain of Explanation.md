  - generally used to explain hate speech.
  - it is a new technique designed to help language models
    understand and explain why certain text might be considered hate speech,
    especially when it is not directly obvious.
  - by using specific clues and information about the targeted environments.
  - this techniques involves organizing input information in a structured way that
    includes hueristic words. the intention behind the text and the group targeted
    by hate speech.
  - Running the language model to generate a details and clear explanation.
  - the focusing on this llm , the chain of explanation method improves the
    quality of the explanations, generated by language models making them more
    informative and easier for people to understand why piece of text is harmful.

How it works:

    - initially, a sequential methodology guides the language model to produce precise 
      explanation from initial nuances clues.
    - and then after it is trained with the diverse examples the model and obscure
      structure sequences to create exhibitions that are informative but straight forward to comprehend.
    - and then the quality of the explanation is then gauged against human judgement,
      emphasizing the clarity and informativeness of output.
