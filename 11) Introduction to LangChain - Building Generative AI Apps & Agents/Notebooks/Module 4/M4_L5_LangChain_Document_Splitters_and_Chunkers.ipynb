    "## Document Splitting and Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading documents into LangChain, you might need to transform them for optimal use in your application. One common transformation is splitting a long document into smaller segments to fit within your model's context window. LangChain provides several built-in document transformers to facilitate the splitting, combining, filtering, and manipulating of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process of Document Splitting:\n",
    "1. **Splitting into Chunks:**\n",
    "   - Break down the text into small, semantically meaningful units (typically sentences).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Combining Chunks:**\n",
    "   - Assemble these smaller units into larger chunks until they reach a predefined size. This size is determined by a specific measurement function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Overlapping Chunks:**\n",
    "   - Once the maximum size is reached, finalize the chunk as an independent text piece.\n",
    "   - Begin a new chunk, incorporating some overlap with the previous chunk to maintain textual context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that semantically related text pieces are kept together, which is crucial for maintaining the meaning and continuity of the document.\n"

    "### RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is a versatile tool within LangChain for splitting text based on a list of characters. This splitter is designed to handle various requirements through adjustable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features and Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character List:** Utilizes a specified list of characters to determine where splits should occur.\n",
    "- **Chunk Size:** Allows you to set the size of each chunk, helping ensure that chunks are manageable and suit the context window of your model.\n",
    "- **Overlap:** Configurable overlap between consecutive chunks to maintain context continuity across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This splitter is particularly useful for texts where precise control over the splitting criteria is needed, allowing for customized chunking strategies based on specific characters.\n"

    "#### Key Features and Parameters:\n",
    "- **Split Character:** By default, it uses a empty string character (\"\") to split the text, but this can be customized to any character you specify.\n",
    "- **Chunk Size:** Allows you to define the length of each chunk in terms of the number of characters. This is useful for ensuring each piece of text is of a manageable size for processing.\n",
    "- **Overlap:** You can set the amount of overlap between consecutive chunks. This helps maintain context and continuity when text is split into separate parts.\n",
