 - in synthesis stage , LLM  generates the response from top-k retrieved documents and the user query.
   but how do we know that if the answer given by LLM is retrieved from retrieved Context only
   or LLM hallunicate based on the knowledge by which it is trained.
   This is where Faithfullness comes.
 - it defines the response generated by LLM is supported by retrieved context or LLM.
 - this is very important as prominent problem with LLM is Hallunication.
