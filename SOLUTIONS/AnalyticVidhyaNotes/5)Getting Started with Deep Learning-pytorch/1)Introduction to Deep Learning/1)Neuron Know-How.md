Neuron Know-How
================


 - deep learning changed the way we work  with machines.
 - it is all begin with creation of artifical neuron simulating human neurons.
 - Artificial neurons are essential mathematical functions

 - above is artificial neuron.
 - before go for gogging , we analze several factors like weather , energy level,health,free time and other things.
 - first part is input
 - this is features in dataset ( images, numbers , text)

- step 2 : weights - importance we give to each factors( weather , energy level,health,free time)
- whenever we make sure decisioning we wont give equal importance to each factor.
- weights are numerical value which are adjusted during training.
- similarly neuron each input is associated with weights.
- in terms of analogy prioritizing weather conditions over all other factors.

- step 3: considering jogging regardless of all other factors.

- Step 4: submission : multiply the each feature * weights and add all together with basic (dot product )

- it is the dot product of features & weights and bias term added.
