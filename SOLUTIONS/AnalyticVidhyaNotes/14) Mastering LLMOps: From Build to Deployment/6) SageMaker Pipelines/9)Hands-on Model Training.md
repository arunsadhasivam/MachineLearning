Hands-on Model Training:
========================


 - now, start with processing step.
 - we would be using processing step to
   1) fill in the missing data(compute missing values),
   2) scale and normalize the numerical fields
   3) split the data in to training , validation and test set
- but the data present where ? it is in s3 bucket.
- from s3 it should be downloaded
