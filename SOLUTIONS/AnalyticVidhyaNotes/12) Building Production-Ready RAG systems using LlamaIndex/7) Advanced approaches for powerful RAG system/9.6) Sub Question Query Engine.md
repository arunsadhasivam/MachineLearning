    - for instance given the user query "compare revenue growth of uber and lyft in 2020,2021" . this cannot be 
      done by simple vector search. specifically if the context is present in multiple document.
     - here lyft and uber document.

    - in this case the subquestion queryEngine split the main query into 4 subqueries.
      1) what was revenue of uber in 2020.
      2) what was the revenue of uber in 2020.
      3) what was revenue of lyft in 2021.
      4) what was the revenue of lyft in 2021.

    - now the first 2 subquery are routed to uber 10k fillings and next 2 queries are routed to lyft
      on 10k fillings.
