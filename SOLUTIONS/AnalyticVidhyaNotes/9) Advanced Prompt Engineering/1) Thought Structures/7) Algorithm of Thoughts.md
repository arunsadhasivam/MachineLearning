  - new way to empower llm with step by step problem solving framework.
 

How Does it work:
==================

  - way it works is streamline the discover of solutions with minimum queries
  - it also offers a comprehensive guide to traverse the problem solving phase.
  - boast sophisticated search strategy that resolves queries more efficiently than Chain of thought , tree of thought.

  - in chain of thought prompting , we have sequential step by step sequential problem solving.
  - in algorithm of thought prompting , it integrates with the incontext example to guide the
    language model through algorithm reasoning pathways efficiently enhancing problem solving capabilities.
  - this in context example that we provide in algorithm of thought prompting provides distinct search
    processes which marked as first operation guiding sub tree exploration for the problem set.
  - here is an example of algorithm of the thought prompting .

  - in standard prompting, we provide the input and output example before obtaining the answer from the
    language model.
  - in chain of thought prompting , it outlines the successive steps to the final solution as a problem
    solving process.
  - in algorithm of thought prompting , it integrates the incontext examples to guide the language models,
    so arithmetic reasoning pathways efficiently.
  - the above examples of (1,2,3) these are the incontext examples which we are providing to the prompting techniques.
  - so this algorithm of thought it integrates those example and this is an example of game of 24. where incontext
    examples include this distinct search processes and algorithm of thought prompting evolves to potiential
    subsequent steps to progress towards a solution or re-trace to another viable subtree if exist, which
    enhance the problem  solving capabilities of llm.


 disadvantages :
 ================

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afbf5112-ad72-4277-a02a-2877ea3ff0d1)

  - high computation due to generation of multiple idea streams.
  - high resource than basic methods.
