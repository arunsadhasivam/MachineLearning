Hands-on Conditional Step Execution:
=====================================

- once we are in this stage , we have
  1) preprocessing dam.
  2) training dam.
  3) also created a evaluation, and the evaluation result was stay in one of
     the evaluation report.json report.

- this is the time , we check for the accuracy.
- as we discussed in the pipeline, one of the step is called **conditional step** which can
  do different things as condition turned out to be true or false.

- first we will create a model
- now, a model is just artificat in s3 which has all the information required to deploy it.
- in our training step, we found out, after training, we created an model and that model was not deployed
  until, we created a endpoint out of it.
- so this is the same model step, to create the model, we simply have to give it a name, docker_container which
  we are going to run on, then we have training step s3_model_artifact where we can also provide model data.
- we just mention it as session pipeline
- we have role for it.



- this model needs to be created, if during the training pipeline run, if the output of that training was really
  good, means MSE(mean square error) was really less.
- we want that s3 model present in s3 modal artifact to be registered in sagemaker as new model.

- model that we are created over here , we want to add certain model metrics, which is evaluation.json which we
  created before
- now, we go ahead and create a register step which is these are steps that should be done to register a model.
- we created a model over here .

- step_eval is where the evaluation file gets created

- we run all the steps
- this is what run all the steps that are needed by the pipeline
- finally create this step create_pipeline
- create_pipeline creates all the steps that are needed by pipeline
